variable.description.2 = Filesystem absolute path to the project that is build at the moment. In contrast to the eclipse build-in project_loc variable, which points to the selected project. This is useful in case of "build all", when projects get build that have not been selected before. The Value of this variable is set when Makefile is generated.
variable.description.3 = variable holds the path to a cmake toolchain file (-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE) for the given architecture.
